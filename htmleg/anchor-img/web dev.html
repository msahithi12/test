        <h4>INTRODUCTION:</h4>
        <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a <small>website</small> for the Internet or an intranet.Web development can range from developing a simple <del>double</del> <ins>single</ins> static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.Web development tools (often called devtools or inspect element) allow web developers to test and debug their code.</em>
        They are different from website builders and integrated development environments (IDEs) <i>in that they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they are tools used for testing the user interface of a website or web application</i>.Web development tools come as browser add-ons or built-in features in web browsers.</p>
