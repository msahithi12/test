    <h2 id="border">What is artificial intelligence (AI)?</h2>
<p class="style">Artificial intelligence leverages computers and machines to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind.
While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) have surfaced over the last few decades, John McCarthy offers the following definition in this 2004 paper (PDF, 106 KB) (link resides outside IBM)," It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable."</p>
