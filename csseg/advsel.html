           <h3>What is machine learning?</h3>
<p>This introduction to machine learning provides an overview of its history, important definitions, applications, and concerns within businesses today.</p>
<i>Machine learning </i>- 
<p>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.</p>

<b>IBM has a rich history with machine learning. </b>
<p>One of its own, Arthur Samuel, is credited for coining the term, “machine learning” with his research (PDF, 481 KB) (link resides outside IBM) around the game of checkers. Robert Nealey, the self-proclaimed checkers master, played the game on an IBM 7094 computer in 1962, and he lost to the computer. Compared to what can be done today, this feat seems trivial, but it’s considered a major milestone in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>

    <h4>Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks</h4>
<b>Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it’s worth noting the nuances between the two. </b>
<p>Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually a sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks.</p></div>
<i>The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm learns. </i>
<div id="gen">
<p>"Deep" machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised learning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn’t necessarily require a labeled dataset. Deep learning can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images), and it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different categories of data from one another.</p></div>
 <div>
    <p>This eliminates some of the human intervention required and enables the use of larger data sets. You can think of deep learning as "scalable machine learning" as Lex Fridman notes in this MIT lecture (01:08:05) (link resides outside IBM).</p>
